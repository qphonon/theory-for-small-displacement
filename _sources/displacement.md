# Methodology

First we define a matrix

$$
A=[ \vec{a}_1|\vec{a}_2 | \vec{a}_3]
$$ (eq:A)
where
the $i$th column of $A$ is taken from
the basic lattice translation vector $\vec{a}_i$ of a crystal.
For simplicity
we use $A$ to describe a primitive cell but it could be easily
extended to deal with a conventional unit cell or even a nonconventional
unit cell.
A space group operator $\{ R | \vec{t} \}$
(in the Seitz notation) corresponds
to a rotation matrix

$$
R_c = A^{-1} R A
$$ (eq:Rc)
in the Cartesian coordinates, which is restricted to
either $p$ or ${\overline p}$ for $p= 1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $6$.
$p$ means a $p$-fold rotation in the international
notation, while $ {\overline p}$ means an
improper rotation (i.e., a $p$-fold rotation followed by an inversion).
The 230 space groups are built on top of
the 32 crystallographic
point groups (see e.g., Refs.~[{cite}`Dresselhaus2008-book`.)



Example

$$
\begin{align}
a_{11}& =b_{11}&
  a_{12}& =b_{12}\\
a_{21}& =b_{21}&
  a_{22}& =b_{22}+c_{22}
\end{align}
$$
